The Simon Game is a console based game that I was used html , css and javascript module and create. that uses color and flash to over background color to challenge players
to repeat sequences of flashing lights by pressing colored pads in the correct order. The game can be played solo or with friends, and
includes four game modes: Levels, Classic, Party, and Extreme. The game starts off at a steady pace, but the patterns get more complicated as you play,
building suspense with each turn. Players earn one point for each green light flash, and level wise points when all the lights flash at once. 
The game unit keeps track of the highest score, which players can use to challenge friends or try to beat their own high score.
The simon game has create a solo or friends to play over based that level wise score also displayed high score and 
the out the game that time player display to screen red background .
